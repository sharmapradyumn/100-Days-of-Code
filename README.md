# 100-Days-of-Code
Me and My Friend([Pradyumn Sharma](https://github.com/sharmapradyumn/)) have started a **100 days of code** for practice and stuff. 
we'll start from hackerrank , than switch to other platforms like codechef and all ....

##### Also just for *FUN* we've added a small >sanction type thing. If anyone of us Failed to push code by the end of day , he'll have to Paytm the other one ***10rs*** **INSTANTLY**.
